# OpsGenie Pack

This pack allows you to integrate with [OpsGenie](https://www.opsgenie.com/).
This is a service to manage alerts and oncall rosters.

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [opsgenie.yaml.example](./opsgenie.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/opsgenie.yaml` and edit as required.

It should contain:

* `api_key` - The integration API key from the OpsGenie integration page.

You'll need an OpsGenie account to create an integration API key.

**Note** : When modifying the configuration in `/opt/stackstorm/configs/` please
           remember to tell StackStorm to load these new values by running
           `st2ctl reload --register-configs`

## Using OpsGenie for hubot Heartbeat

This requires 2 StackStorm installations, with both hubots in the same
channel.

The following needs to be configured in the datastore on both servers
(replace hubot with the other bot name):

```bash
st2 key set opsgenie_timer_hb_user "other_hubot"
st2 key set opsgenie_timer_hb_name "StackStorm ChatOps hubot"
st2 key set opsgenie_timer_hb_channel "chatops_heartbeat"
```

Then you need to add your Heartbeat to OpsGenie and test it:

```bash
st2 run opsgenie.add_heartbeat name="{{system.opsgenie_timer_hb_name}}" interval=30 enabled=true
st2 run opsgenie.send_heartbeat name="{{system.opsgenie_timer_hb_name}}"
```

If both of these are `successful` you can eanble them with:

```bash
st2 rule enable opsgenie.send_heartbeat_timer
```

To get an alert if it expires an integration for Heartbeat should be
configured in the OpsGenie web interface.
